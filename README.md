# What is Spawn Angle 
Spawn angle refers to the angle or direction from which a new object or entity is generated or "spawned" in a video game. This could be a new enemy appearing on the screen, a power-up item dropping from the sky, or a player character respawning after being defeated.
The spawn angle can have a significant impact on gameplay, as it can affect the difficulty and strategy of the game. For example, if enemies always spawn behind the player, it could create a sense of tension and urgency as the player is constantly under attack from all sides. On the other hand, if enemies always spawn in front of the player, it could make the game feel more predictable and give the player more time to prepare for incoming attacks.
In some games, the spawn angle may be random or change dynamically based on certain conditions, while in others it may be predetermined or fixed.


# Difference between cos and sin angles 
Cosine (cos) and sine (sin) are both trigonometric functions that are used to relate angles to the ratios of the sides of a right triangle. However, they differ in how they relate to the sides of the triangle.
Cosine is defined as the ratio of the adjacent side of a right triangle to the hypotenuse. In other words, cos(theta) = adjacent/hypotenuse, where theta is the angle between the adjacent side and the hypotenuse. Cosine is an even function, which means that cos(-theta) = cos(theta).
Sine is defined as the ratio of the opposite side of a right triangle to the hypotenuse. In other words, sin(theta) = opposite/hypotenuse, where theta is the angle between the opposite side and the hypotenuse. Sine is an odd function, which means that sin(-theta) = -sin(theta).
Visually, you can think of sine as the vertical component of an angle, while cosine is the horizontal component of an angle. For example, if you imagine a point moving around a circle, the x-coordinate of the point would be equal to cos(theta), while the y-coordinate would be equal to sin(theta).
In summary, cosine and sine are both trigonometric functions that relate angles to the ratios of the sides of a right triangle, but cosine relates to the adjacent side and hypotenuse, while sine relates to the opposite side and hypotenuse.
